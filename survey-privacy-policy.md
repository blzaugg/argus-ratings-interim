Byran Zaugg d.b.a. Argus Ratings (“we,” “us” or “Argus Ratings”) provides this survey (the "Survey") to users (“you” or the “user”) subject to this Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). The Privacy Policy applies to the Survey. The Survey and Responses (the “Responses”, the “Data” or “submissions”) are the property of Argus Ratings.

## What Data We Collect

We collect information in various ways, such as, by your voluntary submissions, from third parties, and through cookie and other tracking technology. We may collect the following information: 1) information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, age, email and postal code; 2) general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Survey, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on; 3) third party information; 4) cookies and other tracking technologies.

The Survey and Responses are stored using Google services and products and may be subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Please consult [Google’s Privacy and Terms](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/) for further information.

## How We Use Your Information

We may use your information in a variety of ways, including: 1) for internal review; 2) to improve the Argus Ratings website and Argus Ratings Services; 3) to notify you about updates to the Argus Ratings website and Argus Ratings Services; 4) for our marketing purposes; 5) to fulfill and provide products and services, including personalized or enhanced services, requested by you; and 6) internal business analysis or other business purposes consistent with our mission.

We may use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, and we require that such third parties comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may make your identifiable information or the Responses available to our employees and third parties with whom we contract for use to handle your Responses.

The personal information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except under the following circumstances:

 - (a) if required to do so by law or if in good faith, Argus Ratings believes that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 1) comply with any legal process, including but not limited to an enforceable court order or lawful third party subpoena; 2) enforce this Privacy Policy; 3) respond to claims that any Response violates the rights of third parties; or 4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Argus Ratings, its users and/or the public; or

 - (b) if Argus Ratings is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Argus Ratings will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Security

Argus Ratings has safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data, but NO GUARANTEE CAN BE MADE THAT YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA WILL BE SECURE FROM INTRUSIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE TO THIRD PARTIES.

## Compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act

Argus Ratings does not target its offerings toward, and does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Updating Personal Information

We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to correct your personal data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. When requests come to Argus Ratings with regard to personal information, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

## Changes to the Policy

Argus Ratings may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by emailing you. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the bottom of the page by its effective date.
